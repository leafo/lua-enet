**lua-enet** is a binding to the [ENet](http://enet.bespin.org/) library for
Lua. ENet is a thin network communication layer over UDP that provides high
performance and reliable communication that is suitable for games. The
interface exposes an asynchronous way of creating clients and servers that is
easy to integrate into existing event loops.

To get an idea of how ENet works and what it provides have a look at 
[Features and Achritecture](http://enet.bespin.org/Features.html) from the
original documentation.

## Download & Install

### Linux & OSX

Before installing **lua-enet**, you must make sure you have
[ENet](http://enet.bespin.org/) installed. Consult your system's package
management.

If you've got [Lua Rocks](http://www.luarocks.org/) then installation is very
easy:

```bash
$ luarocks install enet
```

Otherwise you can download the source can from GitHub:
<https://github.com/leafo/lua-enet>

## Tutorial

We'll need a client and a server. A server is a *host* bound to an address.
A client is an unbound *host* that connects to an address.
`enet.host_create` is used to create a new host. `host:service` is used to wait
for events and send packets. It can optionally have a specified timeout.

When `host:service` receives an event it returns an event object, which is a
plain Lua table. The `type` entry holds the kind of event as a string, and the
`peer` entry has the associated peer who triggered the event.

Using this information, we can make a simple echo server:


```lua
-- server.lua
require "enet"
local host = enet.host_create"localhost:6789"
while true do
  local event = host:service(100)
  if event and event.type == "receive" then
    print("Got message: ", event.data, event.peer)
    event.peer:send(event.data)
  end
end
```


Data, whether sent or received, is always a Lua string. Primitive types can be
converted to a binary string to reduce the number of bytes sent by using a binary
serialization library.

The client for our server can be written like so:


```lua
-- client.lua
require "enet"
local host = enet.host_create()
local server = host:connect("localhost:6789")

local done = false
while not done do
  local event = host:service(100)
  if event then
    if event.type == "connect" then
      print("Connected to", event.peer)
      event.peer:send("hello world")
    elseif event.type == "receive" then
      print("Got message: ", event.data, event.peer)
      done = true
    end
  end
end
```

server:disconnect()
host:flush()

Upon receiving the connect message we send `"hello world"` to the server, then
wait for the response.

When a client disconnects, make sure to call `disconnect` on the server object,
and then tell the host to flush (unless `host:service` will be called again)
otherwise the server will have to wait for the client to disconnect from timeout.

## Reference

### `enet.host_create([bind_address, peer_count, channel_count, in_bandwidth, out_bandwidth])`

Returns a new host. All arguments are optional.

A `bind_address` of `nil` makes a host that can not be connected to (typically
a client).  Otherwise the address can either be of the form
`<ipaddress>:<port>`, `<hostname>:<port>`, or `*:<port>`.

Example addresses include `"127.0.0.1:8888"`, `"localhost:2232"`, and `"*:6767"`.

Parameters:

 * `peer_count` max number of peers, defaults to `64`
 * `channel_count` max number of channels, defaults to `1`
 * `in_bandwidth` downstream bandwidth in bytes/sec, defaults to `0`
   (unlimited)
 * `out_bandwidth` upstream bandwidth in bytes/sec, defaults to `0`
   (unlimited)

### `host:connect(address [, channel_count, data])`

Connects a host to a remote host. Returns peer object associated with remote
host.  The actual connection will not take place until the next `host:service`
is done, in which a `"connect"` event will be generated.

`channel_count` is the number of channels to allocate. It should be the same as
the channel count on the server. Defaults to `1`.

`data` is an integer value that can be associated with the connect event.
Defaults to `0`.

### `host:service([timeout])`

Wait for events, send and receive any ready packets. `timeout` is the max
number of milliseconds to be waited for an event. By default `timeout` is `0`.
Returns `nil` on timeout if no events occurred.

If an event happens, an event table is returned. All events have a `type` entry,
which is one of `"connect"`, `"disconnect"`, or `"receive"`. Events also have a
`peer` entry which holds the peer object of who triggered the event.

A `"receive"` event also has a `data` entry which is a Lua string containing the
data received.

### `host:check_events()`

Checks for any queued events and dispatches one if available. Returns the
associated event if something was dispatched, otherwise `nil`.

### `host:compress_with_range_coder()`

Enables an adaptive order-2 PPM range coder for the transmitted data of
all pers.

### `host:flush()`

Sends any queued packets. This is only required to send packets earlier than
the next call to `host:service`, or if `host:service` will not be called again.

### `host:broadcast(data [, channel, flag])`

Queues a packet to be sent to all connected peers. See
[peer:send](#peersenddata__channel_flag) for arguments.

### `host:channel_limit(limit)`

Sets the maximum number of channels allowed. If it is `0` then the system
maximum allowable value is used.

### `host:bandwidth_limit(incoming, outgoing)`

Sets the bandwidth limits of the host in bytes/sec. Set to `0` for unlimited.

### `host:total_sent_data()`

Returns the number of bytes that were sent through the given host.

### `host:total_received_data()`

Returns the number of bytes that were received by the given host. 

### `host:service_time()`

Returns the timestamp of the last call to host:service() or host:flush().

### `host:peer_count()`
Returns the number of peers that are allocated for the given host. This
represents the maximum number of possible connections.

### `host:get_peer(index)`

Returns the connected peer at the specified index (starting at 1). ENet
stores all peers in an array of the corresponding host and re-uses unused
peers for new connections. You can query the state of a peer using 
[peer:state](#peerstate).

### `host:get_socket_address()`

Returns a string that describes the socket address of the given host. The
string is formatted as "a.b.c.d:port", where "a.b.c.d" is the ip address of
the used socket.

### `peer:connect_id()`

Returns the field ENetPeer::connectID that is assigned for each
connection.

### `peer:disconnect([data])`

Requests a disconnection from the peer. The message is sent on the next
`host:service` or `host:flush`.

`data` is optional integer value to be associated with the disconnect.

### `peer:disconnect_now([data])`

Force immediate disconnection from peer. Foreign peer not guaranteed to receive
disconnect notification.

`data` is optional integer value to be associated with the disconnect.

### `peer:disconnect_later([data])`

Request a disconnection from peer, but only after all queued outgoing packets
are sent.

`data` is optional integer value to be associated with the disconnect.

### `peer:index()`

Returns the index of the peer. All peers of an ENet host are kept in an
array. This function finds and returns the index of the peer of its host
structure.

### `peer:ping()`

Send a ping request to peer, updates `round_trip_time`. This is called
automatically at regular intervals.

### `peer:ping_interval(interval)`

Specifies the interval in milliseconds that pings are sent to the other
end of the connection (defaults to 500).

### `peer:reset()`

Forcefully disconnects peer. The peer is not notified of the disconnection.

### `peer:send(data [, channel, flag])`

Queues a packet to be sent to peer. `data` is the contents of the packet, it
must be a Lua string.

`channel` is the channel to send the packet on. Defaults to `0`.

<a name="peersenddata__channel_flag"></a>
`flag` is one of `"reliable"`, `"unsequenced"`, or `"unreliable"`. Reliable
packets are guaranteed to arrive, and arrive in the order in which they are sent.
Unsequenced packets are unreliable and have no guarantee on the order they
arrive. Defaults to reliable.

<a name="peerstate"></a>
### `peer:state()`

Returns the state of the peer as a string. This can be any of the
following:

 * "disconnected"
 * "connecting"
 * "acknowledging_connect"
 * "connection_pending"
 * "connection_succeeded"
 * "connected"
 * "disconnect_later"
 * "disconnecting"
 * "acknowledging_disconnect"
 * "zombie"
 * "unknown"

### `peer:receive()`

Attempts to dequeue an incoming packet for this peer.
Returns `nil` if there are no packets waiting. Otherwise returns two values:
the string representing the packet data, and the channel the packet came from.

### `peer:round_trip_time([value])`

Returns or sets the current round trip time (i.e. ping). If value is nil
the current value of the peer is returned. Otherwise the value roundTripTime
is set to the specified value and returned.

Enet performs some filtering on the round trip times and it takes some time
until the parameters are accurate.

### `peer:last_round_trip_time([value])`

Returns or sets the round trip time of the previous round trip time
computation. If value is nil the current value of the peer is returned.
Otherwise the value lastRoundTripTime is set to the specified value and
returned. 

Enet performs some filtering on the round trip times and it takes
some time until the parameters are accurate. To speed it up you can set
the value of the last round trip time to a more accurate guess.

### `peer:throttle_configure(interval, acceleration, deceleration)`
Changes the probability at which unreliable packets should not be dropped.

Parameters:

 * `interval` interval in milliseconds to measure lowest mean RTT
 * `acceleration` rate at which to increase throttle probability as mean RTT
   declines
 * `deceleration` rate at which to decrease throttle probability as mean RTT
   increases

### `(limit, minimum, maximum) peer:timeout(limit, minimum, maximum)`

Returns or sets the parameters when a timeout is detected. This is happens
either after a fixed timeout or a variable timeout of time that takes the
round trip time into account. The former is specified with the `maximum`
parameter.

Parameters:

* `limit` a factor that is multiplied with a value that based on the 
  average round trip time to compute the timeout limit
* `minimum` timeout value in milliseconds that a reliable packet has to
  be acknowledged if the variable timeout limit was exceeded
* `maximum` fixed timeout in milliseconds for which any packet has to be acknowledged
